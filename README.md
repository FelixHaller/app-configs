app-configs
===========

Actually, this repo is for me, to make it easy deploying my dotfile configs on different machines.
But you are free to use it too.

## Install guide:

* clone this repository in a directory of your choice (must not be deleted in the future)
* jump into the directory and execute:
<pre>
./setup.sh
</pre>

The script will create symlinks to all the files in the right places (as long as the files are not present)
